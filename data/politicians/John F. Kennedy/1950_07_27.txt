Mr. Speaker: Our troops who first fought in Korea were woefully lacking in weapons, but there is today an even more dangerous lack. That is the American civilian population’s lack of information on adequate civil defense measures in the event of a surprise atomic attack.

Our troops in Korea are fighting a withdrawing campaign until necessary help arrives – American citizens, if surprise atomic attacks come now or in the near future, could do nothing but perish. There will be no chance for them to fight a holding or withdrawing action.

Our civilians must either be adequately prepared in advance of a surprise attack or otherwise hopeless confusion, panic, fear, despair, and death will be their lot.

In an article in Collier’s Magazine, on the newsstands today, there is a graphic description of what could happen in a typical American city today if an atomic attack came.  Every member of this house should read this article called "Hiroshima, USA."

Since last October I have repeatedly warned of the federal government’s unpardonable delay in telling American citizens how they could best protect themselves against the atom bomb. I say to each member of this House today that we, as Members of Congress, must assume some share of responsibility for the snail-paced civil defense program.

England has done and is doing something about civil defense.

I urge the membership of this House to demand faster civil defense action.

It may be later than we think.
