To me it's like a dream that the next name in the line Harold Macmillan, Alec Douglas-Home and Edward Heath is Margaret Thatcher. Each has brought his own style of leadership and stamp of greatness to the task. I shall take on the work with humility and dedication. I'd like to say “Thank you” for the trust and confidence my supporters have placed in me, and a special thank you to Airey Neave and Bill Shelton and our splendid helpers for their all-out effort on my behalf.

It is important to me that this prize has been won in open electoral contest with four other potential leaders. I know that they'll be disappointed, but I hope that we shall soon be back working together as colleagues for the things in which we believe.

There is much to do and I hope you will allow me time to do it thoughtfully and well.

Finally, I would like to pay tribute to the Chief Whip and his staff, and to Robert Carr for carrying on so magnificently during this period of uncertainty.

Ladies and Gentlemen, your questions.
