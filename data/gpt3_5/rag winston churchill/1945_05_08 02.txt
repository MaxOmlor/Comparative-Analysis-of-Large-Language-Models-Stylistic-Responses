# 
# Yesterday morning at 2:41 a.m. at Headquarters, General Jodl, the representative of the German High Command, and Grand Admiral Doenitz, the designated head of the German State, signed the act of unconditional surrender of all German Land, sea, and air forces in Europe to the Allied Expeditionary Force, and simultaneously to the Soviet High Command.
# 
# General Bedell Smith, Chief of Staff of the Allied Expeditionary Force, and General Francois Sevez signed the document on behalf of the Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force, and General Susloparov signed on behalf of the Russian High Command.
# 
# To-day this agreement will be ratified and confirmed at Berlin, where Air Chief Marshal Tedder, Deputy Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force, and General de Lattre de Tassigny will sign on behalf of General Eisenhower. Marshal Zhukov will sign on behalf of the Soviet High Command. The German representatives will be Field-Marshal Keitel, Chief of the High Command, and the Commanders-in- Chief of the German Army, Navy, and Air Forces.
# 
# Hostilities will end officially at one minute after midnight to-night (Tuesday, May 8), but in the interests of saving lives the “Cease fire” began yesterday to be sounded all along the front, and our dear Channel Islands are also to be freed to-day.
# 
# The Germans are still in places resisting the Russian troops, but should they continue to do so after midnight they will, of course, deprive themselves of the protection of the laws of war, and will be attacked from all quarters by the Allied troops. It is not surprising that on such long fronts and in the existing disorder of the enemy the orders of the German High Command should not in every case be obeyed immediately. This does not, in our opinion, with the best military advice at our disposal, constitute any reason for withholding from the nation the facts communicated to us by General Eisenhower of the unconditional surrender already signed at Rheims, nor should it prevent us from celebrating to-day and to-morrow (Wednesday) as Victory in Europe days.
# 
# To-day, perhaps, we shall think mostly of ourselves. To-morrow we shall pay a particular tribute to our Russian comrades, whose prowess in the field has been one of the grand contributions to the general victory.
# 
# The German war is therefore at an end. After years of intense preparation, Germany hurled herself on Poland at the beginning of September, 1939; and, in pursuance of our guarantee to Poland and in agreement with the French Republic, Great Britain, the British Empire and Commonwealth of Nations, declared war upon this foul aggression. After gallant France had been struck down we, from this Island and from our united Empire, maintained the struggle single-handed for a whole year until we were joined by the military might of Soviet Russia, and later by the overwhelming power and resources of the United States of America.
# 
# Finally almost the whole world was combined against the evil-doers, who are now prostrate before us. Our gratitude to our splendid Allies goes forth from all our hearts in this Island and throughout the British Empire.
# 
# We may allow ourselves a brief period of rejoicing; but let us not forget for a moment the toil and efforts that lie ahead. Japan, with all her treachery and greed, remains unsubdued. The injury she has inflicted on Great Britain, the United States, and other countries, and her detestable cruelties, call for justice and retribution. We must now devote all our strength and resources to the completion of our task, both at home and abroad. Advance, Britannia! Long live the cause of freedom! God save the King!
# 
# [Editor’s Note: After making his broadcast announcement of Germany’s unconditional surrender, Churchill read the same statement to the House of Commons shortly afterwards and added]
# 
# That is the message which I have been instructed to deliver to the British Nation and Commonwealth. I have only two or three sentences to add. They will convey to the House my deep gratitude to this House of Commons, which has proved itself the strongest foundation for waging war that has ever been seen in the whole of our long history. We have all of us made our mistakes, but the strength of the Parliamentary institution has been shown to enable it at the same moment to preserve all the title-deeds of democracy while waging war in the most stern and protracted form. I wish to give my hearty thanks to men of all Parties, to everyone in every part of the House where they sit, for the way in which the liveliness of Parliamentary institutions has been maintained under the fire of the enemy, and for the way in which we have been able to persevere-and we could have persevered much longer if need had been-till all the objectives which we set before us for the procuring of the unlimited and unconditional surrender of the enemy had been achieved. I recollect well at the end of the last war, more than a quarter of a century ago, that the House, when it heard the long list of the surrender terms, the armistice terms, which had been imposed upon the Germans, did not feel inclined for debate or business, but desired to offer thanks to Almighty God, to the Great Power which seems to shape and design the fortunes of nations and the destiny of man; and I therefore beg, Sir, with your permission to move:
# 
# That this House do now attend at the Church of St. Margaret, Westminster, to give humble and reverent thanks to Almighty God for our deliverance from the threat of German domination.
# 
# This is the identical Motion which was moved in former times.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

As we gather here today, I bring forth a matter of utmost importance—a challenge that echoes through the annals of time, resonating in the conscience of every nation and every individual. I speak of the looming specter of climate change, a foe more insidious and relentless than any adversary we have faced before.

The relentless march of industrialization has brought us to a precipice—a juncture where the very balance of our planet teeters on the brink of catastrophe. Like the ominous clouds of war gathering on the horizon, the signs of climate change are unmistakable—the rising temperatures, the melting ice caps, the erratic weather patterns—all harbingers of a crisis that threatens not only our way of life but the very existence of future generations.

Just as our forebears rallied against tyranny and oppression, so too must we summon the courage and resolve to confront this existential threat head-on. For too long, we have turned a blind eye to the consequences of our actions, heedless of the havoc we wreak upon the fragile ecosystem that sustains us all. But the time for complacency is over. The time for action is now.

Let us not falter in the face of this monumental challenge. Let us stand united, as one global community, in defense of our planet and all its inhabitants. Just as we once marshaled our forces to defeat a common enemy, so too must we now marshal our collective will to mitigate the effects of climate change and chart a course towards a sustainable future.

The road ahead will not be easy. It will require sacrifice and determination. But let us draw inspiration from the indomitable spirit of those who came before us—the pioneers, the visionaries, the trailblazers who dared to dream of a better world and took bold action to make it a reality.

In the words of the great Winston Churchill, "We must now devote all our strength and resources to the completion of our task, both at home and abroad." Let us advance, not in conquest, but in stewardship. Let us safeguard our planet for generations yet unborn. Let us, with unwavering resolve, confront the challenge of climate change and emerge victorious, for the cause of freedom, for the preservation of life, and for the future of our world.

God save us all.

Thank you.
