 frank admit issues service house representatives senate troubled much pending bill authorizing participation united states construction operation st lawrence seaway may know different occasions period years massachusetts senator representative ever voted favor seaway opposition part many citizens officials continues day shall discuss bases opposition subsequently initiating comprehensive study issue limited primarily two questions previously massachusetts senators representatives opposing seaway two questions indeed facing members congress issue first st lawrence seaway going built regardless action taken united states senate bill secondly national interest united states participate construction operation administration seaway careful believe thorough objective study issue fully satisfied questions must answered affirmative evidence appears conclusive canada will build seaway although frequently overlook fact seaway opponents now appear take granted studied act passed canadian parliament authorizing construction st lawrence seaway canada dependent upon united states participation power project know participation now assured license granted federal power commission new york state power authority subject rejection final attempt litigation practically assured court appeals construction delayed pending final step canadian law entitled act establish st lawrence seaway authority george vi ch official statements canadian government make clear canada will build seaway alone cooperate power project new york although door left open american participation decide session congress indeed toronto telegram stated editorial january following state union message president eisenhower s call congress get cracking seaway arouses mild skeptical interest country canadians made minds best thing build seaway can longer doubt seaway will built regardless vote today confronted second question national interest united states participate construction operation administration seaway authorized wiley bill question answered affirmative every president secretary army defense secretary commerce national security council national security resources board administration officials past years including president eisenhower representatives administration president stated part message national defense nations now need st lawrence seaway security well economic reasons urge congress promptly approve participation construction mr president ownership control vital strategic international waterway along border lost without passage bill canada builds seaway alone may expensive proposition due difference topography requiring higher tolls longer period time seaway will still paid great extent american interests whose use thereof will many times greater canadians thus economy united states will paid greater part seaway higher cost united states government will voice decisions regarding tolls traffic admission foreign ships defense security measures priorities inasmuch united states going benefit economically militarily construction seaway inasmuch wiley bill provides seaway will self liquidating require comparatively small appropriations year period believe participation national interest therefore defeated sectional reasons refer sectional reasons urged vote seaway two grounds neither related unchangeable fact canada will otherwise build alone participation important two points opposition entirely sectional nature seaway will work economic hardship upon massachusetts seaway will direct economic benefit massachusetts like discuss questions briefly inasmuch explain basis much traditional opposition measure state states also believe involve nature responsibility united states senate federal union first will seaway work economic hardship massachusetts course inasmuch seaway built anyway regardless american participation arguments necessity academic issue whether seaway built whether united states participate project however inasmuch devoted considerable time effort senate analysis alleviation economic problems now troubling new england especially concerned many predictions injury state region resulting seaway port boston primary attention discussion seaway s effect upon economy centered upon port boston therefore analyzed carefully figures port traffic largely furnished boston port authority first place least port traffic coastwise intraport local one claimed will affected seaway remaining foreign traffic examination imports reveals practically coal fuel oil petroleum food products beverages items consumption within new england area raw materials used new england manufacturers wool rubber make large part remainder import traffic obvious none traffic will diverted seaway respect goods shipped rail new england area opportunity see comprehensive analysis new england s chief rail exports small portion foreign made imports arriving port boston even smaller portion items went area st lawrence seaway serve consequently extremely small percentage foreign import trade will lost port boston even much imports lost alleged figures support even lost total loss tonnage less annual traffic handled port respect exports total less port traffic opponents seaway suggested export grain trade might affected seaway operation analysis new england rail traffic bears denied port s export grain trade may affected seaway however terms tonnage handled trade amounted total traffic port boston due mechanical nature operation involved small number employees thus although grain bottom cargo significance beyond tonnage nevertheless even entire export grain trade lost port effect upon traffic economy boston new england almost negligible short even port boston lose export grain much foreign import trade result seaway figure exceeds claims strongest opponents supported traffic analysis even circumstances decline terms total traffic port less since variations port s traffic year year practically always greater speculation seaway built canada iron ore begins move labrador boston port receive traffic however rail haul boston steel producing areas pennsylvania ohio illinois considerably greater competing ports baltimore philadelphia new york although latter may affected current interstate commerce commission case even clearer newer steel developments maryland new jersey pennsylvania will served ports considerably closer boston think speculative overly optimistic hope boston get substantial share trade seaway built course already indicated seaway going built will provide transportation iron ore water haul equal haul labrador boston rail haul approximately distance boston youngstown atlantic port carry ore therefore extremely doubtful whether either port boston new england railroads wish make considerable expenditures adapting facilities handle iron ore traffic will certainly carried seaway within period several years short feel effect seaway upon port boston will lasting significance believe long run traffic port will stimulated important port boston pointed president s committee new england economy fact sampling new england firms showed exports shipped new york instead boston new england decried loss port boston resulting seaway divert export traffic port gain many times great loss suffered construction seaway new england railroads reasons unable find serious injury new england railroads resulting construction seaway analysis new england s rail traffic mentioned indicates new england s chief rail exports largely consumption goods highly manufactured industrial products equipment high unit value cost transportation relatively small portion doubtful goods shipped miles gaspe peninsula go seaway instead quicker direct route via rail moreover small portion goods go area served seaway whenever goods diverted course will gain port boston respect goods shipped rail new england far largest single item coal west virginia kentucky coal producing states like items shipped region rail will continue come direct route seaway diversion goods consumption massachusetts new england will gain port boston major exception grain already discussed fact export grain may lost new england railroads ports represents entire rail traffic handled new england railroads grain shipped new england affected seaway inasmuch present routes utilizing erie canal railroads considerably shorter economical even seaway will provide contrary increased industrial activities middle west may well build markets new england manufacturers traffic new england railroads ports permit repeat one unchangeable fact makes discussion possible gain loss massachusetts irrelevant pending measure namely seaway going built economic consequences going felt whether beneficial regardless vote united states senate however discussion possibilities economic gain port railroads leads sectional question namely will st lawrence seaway help massachusetts great many claims advanced along lines help state studied care must say frankness think wholly speculative best know direct economic benefit economy massachusetts segment thereof seaway urged oppose seaway grounds inasmuch initial investment even though repaid will come part massachusetts tax revenues unable accept narrow view functions united states senator speaking senate floor behalf new england economy stressed opposition idea new england s interest best served opposing federal programs contribute well country particularly programs increase purchasing power new england s customers federal action necessary appropriate firm belief new england must fight national policies moreover sought support senators sections country efforts behalf new england pointing concern important region country also fact increase economic activity new england benefit nation whole reasons oppose seaway direct economic benefits will go largely great lakes middle western areas conscientiously take position time expect support senators middle west part country programs projects aid new england seaway going built question part shall play opening fourth coastline state elsewhere oppose participation construction project national security merely economic benefits go elsewhere say arbitrary refusal many new englanders recognize legitimate needs aspirations sections contributed neglect even opposition needs region representatives areas continue narrow destructive position well stated famous massachusetts senator years ago aim states dissevered discordant belligerent one country one
