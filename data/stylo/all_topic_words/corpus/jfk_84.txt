assistance depleted state reserves general limitations loan programs lending money state fund imperiled heavy unemployment unlike federal aid program congress concerned national problems health public assistance education programs familiar committee grants aid states basis need require aid repaid federal repayable loan fund can hope deal temporary crises instead preventing disaster state reserve suffering heavy chronic unemployment merely postpones emergency taxation pay back loan long term problem decline textile employment serious recession repayable loan sufficient state struck economic catastrophe must raise rates safeguard fund repay loan loses industry unable compete low tax areas thus faced dwindling tax collections mounting unemployment claims requiring state able repay loan circumstances increases competitive disadvantages employers contrary original purpose law improperly distributes costs business cycle requiring state raise tax rates repay loan time payrolls diminishing businesses need help finally basic objection loan program fact many states including rhode island appear bound constitutional restrictions seeking loans one purpose unemployment insurance program share risk tax rate employer cover full burden unemployment industry tax might high pooling risk within state burden evenly distributed similarly risks pooled federal state basis whereby state funds fall dangerously low level fault receive insurance payments reinsurance reserve states contribute support s purpose introduced senators rhode island although realize alternative methods establishing reinsurance program committee consider certainly loan fulfill principal sharing risk among states limitations loan program h r loan features bill committee particularly unhelpful compare will provisions lending provisions george loan fund title xii unemployment compensation act originally recommended expired january first size loan fund h r limited maximum million little new york s claims normal year maximum included george fund b secondly eligibility provisions loan h r restrictive requiring state reserve lower total benefits paid previous months although loan exceed amount benefits paid highest preceding quarters george provision state eligible whenever reserve fell annual rate collections higher two previous calendar years situation likely occur unless state already

balance state fund exceeded higher annual tax collections two previous calendar years president eisenhower recommending loan fund specified repayment hard hit state begin years interests allowing state reasonable interim readjust economy attract new industries reasons believe loan fund provisions h r offer substantial assistance depleted state funds ii h r waste unemployment compensation funds needed benefit payments second feature h r distributes states basis covered payrolls funds expended year administration loan fund opinion one extraordinary fiscally irresponsible propositions ever come body provision states receive monies raised federal tax regardless need funds regardless amounts contributed funds regardless amount may already received similar purposes bill extremely stringent lending money states need distributes far larger sums without standards states regardless need surely federal grant aid program approved basis whereby new york receive times much delaware regardless need bill require funds used benefits states today clearly use federal gift administrative expenses yet congress already appropriates administrative expenditures program determined state reviewed department labor congress amount appropriated proves insufficient congress provides supplemental appropriation bill requires distribution funds administrative purposes beyond congress determines necessary appropriations purposes thus renders meaningless congressional function bill also requires state legislatures appropriate funds congress raised stated treasury department sound administration counsels system whereby legislative body appropriates funds responsibility raising undesirable occurs congress already appropriated deems necessary proper efficient administration provision permitting reduction taxes prosperous periods eliminating aid recession addition unsound moreover period heavy unemployment may require federal state administrative expenses tax collects instead establishing contingency fund years reed bill requires year s surplus distributed full general treasury expenditures required year certainly committee concerned cash budget statutory debt limit question proposal encouraging states find new ways spend monies otherwise retained federal treasury including states far may already receive congressional appropriations administrative expenses paid funds saved benefit payments states today future whose reserves threatened serious unemployment least contingency fund years heavy administrative expenses iii conclusion conclusion mr chairman let add bill increases prospects complete federalization unemployment compensation provides excessive payments federal funds states requires state legislatures appropriate funds raised federal tax encourages state employment agencies expand various administrative services subsidized federal funds lending provisions require change constitutional structure many states harsh provisions repayment keep states continually dependent upon federal loans replenish state reserves unable build finally states whose reserves adequately aided bill whose benefits may sharply reduced taxes sharply raised order prevent collapse heavy unemployment will certainly demand complete federalization entire unemployment compensation system reasons congress now see fit safeguard state funds program reinsurance believe preferable action enact reed bill waste badly needed funds lending provisions liberalized provision distribution surplus funds stricken least restricted benefit payments constitute improvement far logical adopt suggestion administration house minority report george loan fund provision re enacted comprehensive legislation along lines outlined possible commission intergovernmental relations whose establishment recommended senate committee government operations member completes study subject present bill unjustifiable raid unemployment compensation benefits impair jobless insurance
