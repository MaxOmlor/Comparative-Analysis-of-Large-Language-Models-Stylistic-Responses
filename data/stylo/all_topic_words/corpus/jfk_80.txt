believe within two years chinese communists will developed modern divisions will become soviet union united states greatest single military power world lacking atomic arsenal industrial capacity sustain put first rank power will direction native leadership increasingly evidenced aggressive rapacious intentions towards countries along southern border circumstances must ask new dulles policy dependence upon threat atomic retaliation will fare areas guerrilla warfare point threat atomic weapons used struggles southeast asia french indochina particularly chief burden carried one side native

assist forces freedom areas well entrenched communist guerrilla native armies brush fire begins spread particularly spreads series localized combustions new policy might confronted serious dilemma third question presented mr dulles policy involves constitutional political nature government constitution president must seek consent congress declaration war even absence formal declaration congressional consent required drastic step taken ordering strategic air force action country might retaliate bombs citizens yet president goes congress asks consent give warning enemy intentions warning might present conditions permit retaliation us blow became effective can see new strategy recently announced secretary state implications utmost seriousness will now formerly resist aggression wherever occurs now united states committed instant retaliation aggressor anywhere choose weapons choose now making clear communists act aggression will followed retaliation united states home
