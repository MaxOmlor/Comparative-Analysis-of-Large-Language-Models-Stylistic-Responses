 american legion largest veterans organization kind world members years existence since end world war compiled enviable record carrying principles legion formed therefore privilege address executive committee great organization today one articles legion s oath make right master might legion never believed right march unescorted unarmed difficult dangerous world therefore since earliest days american legion made one foremost aims battle strong adequate national defense fought successive waves drift slide last years cost us heavily meeting therefore believe proper place argue need defense effort keeping perils time one present national policy american legion will many opportunities important public service coming months already becoming apparent may field national security service will enduring significance course good reason believe ultimate reliance soviet union will weapons subversion economic disintegration guerrilla warfare accomplish destruction rather upon direct assault war count long soviet union satellites continue dedicate large percentage national production preparation war long must united states recognize peril now subjected increasing quantities time friend long favorably used growing indications many categories defense years since korea enabled communists overcome deficiencies atomic power time continue widen gap separates us ground air sea evidence obvious armies soviet union satellites available attack continent europe several times size force now guards western europe invasion according admiral carney navy chief operation speaking boston last monday soviet union now second greatest naval power world surpassed general naval strength great britain particular concentrated effort development powerful sea fleet world ever seen fact five times submarine fleet germans nearly succeeded isolating british early days last war submarines infinitely effective dangerous threats national security far greater importance presented menace soviet atomic hydrogen weapons united states seldom ever recent history united states many conflicting statements made issue responsible officials made last week washington present danger united states atomic attack soviet union arthur fleming head office defense mobilization stated soviet union capable delivering destructive weapon ever devised man chosen targets united states mr wilson secretary defense stated doubt little soviets bombs ready drop airplanes drop stated spend little five hundred millions dollars without upsetting fundamental defense program w sterling cole chairman joint committee atomic energy called hand expenditure ten billion dollars year air defense president eisenhower attempted resolve conflict saying soviets now capability atomic attack us capability will increase passage time statements spite contradictory emphasis furnished clear evidence see united states enter critical period long history time rapidly approaching soviet union will long range planes carry united states weapon capable infinite destruction traditional advantages initial attack always given aggressor will multiplied thousandfold destructiveness atomic fire power dire threat survival poses difficult strategic problem recognizing threat may exist years economic resources unlimited responsible security must determine whether rely safety elaborate system continental defense combined reasonably powerful strategic air force whether recognizing even optimum conditions limited security possible maginot line around united states concentrate ability strategic air force containing retaliatory powers soviets will impelled hold hand present time unfortunately neither continental defenses insecure air force suffered heavily successive stretch outs fall joint chiefs staff recognizing decisive nature atomic weapons broke compromise three services made equal distribution funds determined view soviet effort capabilities minimum goal security year air groups targets army navy meanwhile remained although stretch ordered president truman provided wings june lessened impact decision air force strength primacy air weapons still recognized truman budget called expenditure sixteen billion dollars air eleven billion army navy respectively smoke congressional battle cleared last july however six months later five billion taken air force billion navy billion added army return balanced force concept vengeance wring rather stretch air force strength preliminary budgets released next year defense department prepared new joint chiefs staff therefore disappointing words new york times seen furthering large degree return principle balanced forces existed korean war result will united states will possess wings june instead wings june june believe balanced force concept takes account decisive nature atomic hydrogen weapons kelly report made request department defense estimated major portion atomic bombs properly placed attack result destruction least one third industrial capacity kill thirteen million people study also warned capabilities stop attacking bombers run high perfect conditions fraction conditions adverse statistics made even sombre statement congressman cole week warned us given passage enough time need great research production program sufficient vigor fear soviets may come possess five ten weapons hundreds even thousands soviet developing basic well rounded military strength concentrated since end world war ii building world s largest air force red air force contains planes summer estimated will number jets alone good portion present air force strength wings made propeller driven planes jets obsolete russians medium bomber based b capable flying one way missions united states producing heavy turbo prop bomber comparable b sufficient jet light bombers provided one hundred chinese communist air force result soviet contribution now fourth largest air force world numerous four jet light bombers equivalent b stationed eastern europe capable attacking lightning speed point western europe will soon produce plane similar b according secretary air force reports new larger bomber development akin b planes course supported thousands mig s even illuminating relative air strength words recent article based upon report robert h orr fifth air force chief combat operation korea quote last year korean war u s fifth air force operated sixteen wings support fighting force made follows three medium bomber wings b s detached strategic air command two fighter interceptor wings f s five fighter bomber wings f s f s two light bomber wings world war ii propeller driven b s one reconnaissance wing f s b s three oversized troop carrier wings using variety transports cargo carriers time committed wings represented small fraction air force s modern ready fighter interceptor strength two wings ready fighter bomber strength strategic air command prepared spare ready resources including b s course b jets enter sac units last spring likewise estimated soviet interceptor input korean war including lost mig s still incorporated ccaf must order probably higher number equip fifty two usaf interceptor wings almost twice many proposed wing program large equity marginal war demonstrates clearly extent soviet investment air power believe therefore justified making certain obvious conclusions first neglect continental civil defense systems present can assumed attacking force equipped atomic hydrogen bombs bring widespread destruction possibly speedy victory secondly can sure soviets today making maximum effort improve capabilities air power atomic hydrogen weapons thirdly view facts appears obvious united states alternative give priority development strategic air force sufficient retaliatory powers threaten potential aggressor havoc ruin fourthly believe present program air power expansion gives us air force present effort judged comparison done past rather soviets now today help alarmed present progress see country productively powerful world people enjoying highest standard living history can satisfied anything less air force second none today
