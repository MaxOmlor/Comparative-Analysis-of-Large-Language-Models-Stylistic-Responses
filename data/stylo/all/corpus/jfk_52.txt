Mr. Speaker, the United States should renounce the 1947 Italian Peace Treaty. It has been harshly restrictive, unfair, and dangerous for Italy since its inception; it is a harshly restrictive, an unfair, and a dangerous treaty today for the whole free world. Particularly is it dangerous today to our attempts to develop military strength for the defense of the west against the threat of Soviet land power.
It is today this country’s first aim to build up as quickly and as effectively as possible, a combined Western European military defense system sufficiently powerful to deter the Russians from resorting to force in that area.
Each of the 11 European member nations of the North Atlantic Pact is a link in this chain of resistance. The importance of France and Great Britain is obvious. But it is well to direct fresh attention to the immense importance of Italy. Consider if Italy was under the military domination of the Russians and the Italian Communist Party were in positions of control in Rome instead of Signor de Gasperi and his Christian Democrat, Socialist, and Republican Ministers. The security of Europe would be undermined, the position of Greece and Turkey would be endangered, and the West’s control of the Mediterranean and of North Africa would be neutralized.
Fortunately, this is not now the case. But both inside and outside Italy the defenders of freedom still need to do all in their power to support and sustain the present democratic Government in Rome.
The people of Italy, themselves, who have brought their country under De Gasperi’s leadership so well through the difficult postwar days, need to know better and to understand the growing strength of that west to which their destiny is now bound. Equally, their own position and problems need to be known and understood and appreciated in the rest of the western world, both for the contribution which they are making and will make to the common security of the North Atlantic Treaty members.
What of Italy’s contribution to the common security? How strong a partner can we expect her to be in the critical Western European rearmament program?
Nine articles of the 1947 peace treaty can best answer those questions:
First. Article 47, permanent Italian fortification and military installations along the French-Italian border and their armaments shall be destroyed or removed.
Second. Article 48, permanent Italian fortifications and military installations along the Italian-Yugoslav frontier is prohibited: Permanent fortifications where weapons capable of firing into Yugoslav territory or territorial waters can be employed; permanent military installations capable of being used to conduct or direct fire into Yugoslav territory or territorial waters.
In a coastal area 15 kilometres deep, stretching from the frontier between Italy and the free territory of Trieste to the latitude of 44° 50’ north, and in the islands adjacent to this coast, Italy shall not establish any new, nor expand any existing, naval bases or permanent naval installations.
Third. Article 51, Italy shall not possess, construct, or experiment with, one. Any atomic weapon; two, any self-propelled or guided missiles or apparatus connected with their discharge; three, any guns with a range of over 30 kilometres; four, sea mines; or, five, torpedoes.
Fourth. Article 54, total number of heavy and medium tanks shall not exceed 200.
Fifth. Article 58, no battleship shall be constructed, acquired, or replaced by Italy. No aircraft carrier, submarine, or other submersible craft, motor torpedo boats, or specialized types of assault craft shall be constructed, acquired, employed, or experimented with by Italy.
Total standard displacement of the war vessels, other than battleships of the Italian Navy, shall not exceed 67,500 tons.
Sixth. Article 60, total personnel of the Italian Navy shall not exceed 25,000 officers and men.
Seventh. Article 61, the Italian Army, including the frontier guards, shall be limited to a force of 185,000 combat, service, and overhead personnel, and 65,000 carabinieri.
Eighth. Article 64, the Italian Air Force shall be limited to a force of 200 fighter and reconnaissance aircraft, and 150 transport, air-sea rescue, training, and liaison aircraft, including reserve aircraft.
Ninth. Article 65, the personnel of the Italian Air Force shall be limited to a total of 25,000.
It is plain from these crippling restrictions, that if the treaty were being adhered to, Italy not only could not be expected to contribute effectively to Western European defense, but could not even adequately defend her own borders from aggression.
It is indeed paradoxical that Italy so hamstrung by this treaty which has proved itself to be unjust and unrealistic, is 1 of the 12 member nations of the North Atlantic Pact. For the current fiscal year Congress has appropriated over $4,500,000,000 to assist these countries under the military-aid program. The amount of aid planned to be extended to Italy is substantial.
This fact alone makes it difficult for me to understand why the United States has not renounced the peace treaty. This Nation cannot, certainly in conscience, pretend to abide, on the one hand, by a treaty which so severely limits Italy’s defense rearmament and, on the other give assistance, probably in hundreds of millions of dollars, to the present Italian defense program.
It may be argued that there is no immediate need for lifting the treaty’s military restrictions because Italy is still below her treaty strength. There is no doubt, however, that before too long, probably by next fall, these restrictions will seriously hamper Italy’s getting on with her defense program. She is trying herself, as evidenced in the $400,000,000 she has recently appropriated for defense expenditures this year. And in a conversation with Defense Minister Pacciardi in Rome this winter, he was optimistic in his hopes for developing an effective defense organization.
But he also pointed out the bad psychological effect of the peace treaty on Italy’s rearmament efforts – when on the one hand the Italians are being urged to sacrifice their hard-won economic recovery for rebuilding defense forces, by the same Western Powers who, on the other hand, are limiting through the treaty the size that these defense forces may attain.
In regard to the possibility of a renunciation of the treaty’s restriction of Italy’s armed strength provoking Russia, it is well to note the situation among Soviet satellites who were former enemies. Rumania was authorized 138,000 men in her treaty; Bulgaria 65,500. United States officials have estimated that Rumania today has 275,000 men under arms and Bulgaria 190,000. And these forces are steadily being strengthened with Russian heavy equipment.
The utter folly of our failure to renounce the Italian peace treaty, with its crushing limitations on defense manpower and border fortifications, would indeed be all too clear if the Soviet satellites above should move, backed by Russia, against Yugoslavia, for the road to Italy would be open.
The treaty is dangerous to the security of the free world. But also today, as in 1947, the treaty is unfair and unjust for Italy.
One of the arguments put forth by the proponents of the 1947 treaty, when it was being discussed in the Senate, was that the treaty would pave the way for Italy’s admission to the United Nations. At such time as Italy joined the United Nations, many of the defense restrictions could be revised between Italy and the Security Council, the treaty itself stated.
We have seen the wistfulness of such an argument. Up until today, Italy’s admission to the United Nations has been advocated four times. Each time she has been barred from membership because of a Russian veto.
Therefore, we and the other signatories of the treaty, in 1947, as much as said to Italy – here, sign this treaty. It is harsh, and your national security is no doubt weakened by its restrictions. But after the treaty has been ratified, you can join the United Nations, and these problems can be ironed out there.
And yet, up until now, nothing has been done by our Government to insure Italy’s ability to defend herself even though we know that Russia will continue to block her admission to the United Nations.
Recently we have seen, in a speech by John Foster Dulles, chief of the peace mission for Japan, how our Government is planning to have "a peace of reconciliation" with Japan. We intend to restore Japan, in Mr. Dulles’ words, "to a position of dignity and equality among the nations." As for the security of Japan, we have gone so far as to inform her that, if the Japanese wanted it, the United States would sympathetically consider the retention of United States Armed Forces in and about Japan, so that the coming into force of a treaty of peace would not leave Japan a vacuum of power, and as such, an easy prey to such aggression as has already shown itself in nearby Korea.
With this stand I have no quarrel. But it is difficult to reconcile the treatment proposed to be given Japan, an all-out enemy, to the treatment given to Italy, which, in fact, was a co-belligerent with us from September 1943 on, against Nazism.
Have we forgotten that more than 100,000 Italian partisans died fighting against the Germans? That both Field Marshal Alexander and Gen. Mark Clark called the Italian resistance movement, the partisans, the most effective in Europe? That the Italian resistance movement and six regular divisions which went into combat on our side, saved many thousands of American and British lives? Have we forgotten that from the Italian armistice in 1943, until the end of the war, Italian casualties exceeded the combined casualties of the British and American Armies in Italy?
Back in 1947, A. A. Berle, Jr., former Assistant Secretary of State, in charge of Italian affairs, speaking of the then proposed treaty, said, "The Government of the United States made a single pledge to the Italian people prior to the landing of troops in Italy. This pledge was that the United States would assure the preservation of the essential nationhood of Italy. This pledge was properly read against the background of the Atlantic Charter and the repeated declarations of war aims."
In October 1944, President Roosevelt said, "To the people of Italy we have pledged our help, and we will keep the faith."
Was the ratification of this treaty, or is our continued failure to lift our voices against it keeping the faith? Have our actions in regard to this treaty been in accord with the principles of the Atlantic Charter?
It must be remembered that the terms of the Italian Peace Treaty were negotiated during the days when we were appeasing Russia, and when the wishful hope that we could live in peace with the Soviet dominated our foreign policy.
If our country is to deserve its place of leadership among the free nations of the world, if our foreign policy of containing Russian expansion is to be a consistent one, if we are to keep the faith with Italy and live up to the principles enunciated in the Atlantic Charter, if, indeed, the North Atlantic Treaty organization is to have any true meaning, it is imperative that at once our Government take steps to renounce this treaty which has, first, mutilated the integrity of the Italian homeland; second, imposed the renunciation by Italy of her colonies; third, enforced enslavement by compelling the payment of $365,000,000, $100,000,000 of which is to be paid to Russia; and fourth, reduced the Italian national defense forces to a point at which her own and all of Western Europe’s security is endangered.
Consequently, Mr. Speaker, I have today introduced a House joint resolution which provides for the relief of the Government of Italy from its obligations to the United States under the present peace treaty, and which requests the President to join with other signatories as may accept, in negotiating a new peace treaty.
