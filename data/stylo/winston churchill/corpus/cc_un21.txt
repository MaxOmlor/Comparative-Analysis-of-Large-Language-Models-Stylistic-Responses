Clean energy is the gift that keeps giving:
It can purify polluted air;
Meet growing energy demand;
Secure supplies;
And connect billion of people to affordable power – helping to ensure electricity access to all by 2030.
That is all while saving money and saving the planet.
A fair, just, equitable, and urgent transition from dirty fossil fuels to clean energy is essential to avoid the worst of climate chaos and spur sustainable development. 
So, I celebrate this first International Day of Clean Energy;
I applaud the work of the International Renewable Energy Agency; 
And I welcome the call made by countries at COP28 to triple renewable energy capacity by 2030.
It is my firm belief that fossil fuel phase out is not only necessary, it is inevitable.
But we need governments to act, to accelerate the transition, with the biggest emitters leading the way.
That means unleashing a surge in climate finance – particularly, governments reforming the business model of multilateral development banks so that affordable finance flows.
It means countries creating new national climate plans by 2025 that map a fair and just transition to clean power.
And it means governments closing the door on the fossil fuel era – with justice and equity.
Our clean energy future is unstoppable.
Together, let’s bring it into being faster.
Thank you.
