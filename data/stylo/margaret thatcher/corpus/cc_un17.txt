Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,
Agradeço a todos por se terem reunido nesta bela ilha de São Miguel para discutir um assunto da maior importância como a aviação regional sustentável.
Dear friends,
This Forum arrives on the heels of the hottest year on record.
A carbon-free future is the only way forward.
And the aviation sector can help deliver this future.
Aviation is foundational to our world — connecting people, creating jobs, and sustaining economies.  
But it’s also one of the most challenging sectors to decarbonize.
It accounts for 2 per cent of global emissions.
The message is clear.
The aviation industry must transition from fossil fuels, and embrace a clean energy future.
This Forum is an opportunity to showcase how this sector can step up and lead our world towards a carbon-neutral future.  
The ideas and solutions being discussed here help point the way.
Developing and applying clean fuel sources on a global scale.
Enacting smart economic policies and regulations that can support a just and equitable transition — including carbon pricing, low-carbon fuel standards and subsidies for sustainable aviation fuels.
And universally aligning with the International Civil Aviation Organization’s Assembly’s goal of net-zero emissions by 2050 — not through offsets, but by actually reducing emissions.
The scale of the climate crisis demands that all countries, sectors and companies find real solutions that address the problem.  
Let’s speed-up the clean energy revolution our world needs — with aviation at the forefront.
