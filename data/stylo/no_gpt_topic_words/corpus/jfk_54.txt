 defense production act amendments mr speaker believe defense production bill form come house wholly inadequate accomplish vital task stabilizing prices wages rents opposed especially following provisions bill first prohibition rollbacks beef prices second authorization percent increase rent maximum rent plus percent increase allowably adjusted increases since third amendment bill offered education labor committee seriously hamper wage stabilization board s tasks stabilizing wages just reasonable manner also opposed shortcomings bill first failure require public utilities common carriers regulated state city municipal body subject federal price control entirely uncontrolled utilities public carriers raised prices high many producers asked office price stabilization price increases passed along public second failure authorize office price stabilization license businesses selling articles subject price control ex president hoover stated licensing power essential price control truly effective third failure meet realistically food price problem caused present law s provision price ceiling may set agricultural products called parity level fourth failure permit effective control commodity speculation profiteering opposition prohibition roll backs beef prices based facts office price stabilization announced first beef roll back april beef cattle prices percent parity first roll back amounting percent went effect may felt consumer s retail level order allow meat industry make adjustments change next announced roll backs staggered several months roll backs percent scheduled august october time consumer finally obtain relief increasingly high beef prices even scheduled october roll backs beef prices higher highest ever paid korea stand percent parity obviously roll backs beef reasonable interest american consumer fair beef producers provision present bill prohibits roll backs effect favor special interest group already well taken care government stricken bill prohibition roll backs will severe blow attempts meet threat inflation increased food prices will result demands higher wages never ending consequences price wage spirals percent increase rents maximum rents provided bill although seeming reasonable add burden americans already heavily burdened present high cost living lower middle income rent payers native city boston example bureau labor statistics says average rent increase till year amounts percent average percentage increase large cities country amounts percent bureau labor statistics also tells us harm say proponents bill s percent authorized increase rents can done rent payers nation average increase already percent bill provides say rent already increased percent since will affected checking statistics given bureau labor statistics however found facts boston housing officials assured boston typical large metropolitan cities country approximately rental units total dwelling units boston area never rent control remaining units signed percent rent increase lease authorized couple years ago congress individual rent increase adjustments made general increase granted boston since percent general tax increase allowance thus apparent taking duplication landlords receiving percent increase leases received individual adjustments consideration upward half boston s controlled rent payers increased percent granted general tax increase therefore boston tenants will bill s rent control provision stand rent increased percent bitterly opposed rent increase time struggling keep cost living consequently shall offer amendment present bill cutting authorized increase percent percent effect proposed amendment abolish existing wage stabilization board substitute new board strip board responsibility day day administration wage stabilization controls confine limit jurisdiction proposed amendment rolls back dispute settlement authority granted executive order freezes authority president deal national industrial relations problems arise prohibit use board solution national industrial relations problems bill present form will job vitally needs done passed present form increases responsibility congress president must assume failing meet problems inflation vigor required responsibility president rests failure request full complete powers limit rise cost living beginning hostilities korea delay using limited powers granted responsibility congress rests failure accept recommendations mr baruch year ago willingness present bill listen siren call special interest happened past year cost living full impact defense effort upon economy felt indicative necessity strong action fronts war inflation facts plain prices month ending may according recent labor department consumer s price index cost living reached time high percent average following breakdown gives comparative figures may last year june just prior outbreak korean war may may june may percent percent percent items food apparel rent fuel electricity refrigeration house furnishings miscellaneous thus almost percent rise living costs since korean war started nearly percent rise wholesale prices period wages average weekly earnings manufacturing workers estimated april year average earning april june korea month latest estimate average weekly earnings retail trade workers march year year ago march korea month manufacturing workers figures show rise wages percent since korea retail trade workers rise less percent since korea indeed clear proof workingman including white collar worker lagged well behind increase cost living credit prices wages commonly thought important elements leading inflation another factor greatly added acceleration inflation face namely large scale borrowing banks matter fact many expert economists believe uncurbed expansion bank credit greatest danger face today april last year bank loans totaled april year increase commercial bank credit april estimate total loans estimated business loans expanded period real estate consumer loans expanded business loans although factual data available considered improbable government officials small percentage went direct defense production commonly agreed overwhelming portion went post korea share buying inventory build ups nondefense business profit corporate profits year amounted taxes taxes first quarter year running estimated rate taxes amounted taxes corresponding figures profits steady rise profits clearly evident figures showing annual rates seasonally adjusted running quarter last year first quarter year billions dollars taxes taxes first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter first quarter thus see corporate profits first quarter surpassed previous period taxes hit hard first quarter year first quarter rise percent elements prices wages credit profits effect spiraling costs progressive weakening value money call inflation invasion south korea korean communists resultant spurt defense efforts unmistakably clear government take steps adequately build armed forces also insure stability national economy congress result voted moneys build army navy air force likewise passed defense production act think safe say defense forces build except fact defense item prices soared tremendously progressed fairly well since although personally feel military goals set far ahead role played inflation defense build evident report department defense joint economic committee states terms number guns can procured available funds effect inflationary prices increase almost half guns order destroyed enemy action know eminently safe say fight inflation unsound economy government failed failed badly eyes every segment american public consequently well consider time weapons government used fight weapons far proven ineffectual economy country riddled symptoms inflation today defense mobilization taking percent bite national production clear improved weapons must forged approach mobilization will biting estimated percent national production title iv defense production act passed law last september states intent congress provide authority necessary achieve following purposes order promote national defense prevent inflation preserve value national currency assure defense appropriations dissipated excessive costs prices stabilize cost living workers consumers costs production farmers businessmen eliminate prevent profiteering hoarding manipulation speculation disruptive practices resulting abnormal market conditions scarcities protect national economy future loss needed purchasing power present dissipation individual savings prevent future collapse value title vi authorized president federal reserve system exercise control regulate consumer real estate credit today one objectives realized inversely indeed act said intent congress create inflation dissipate defense appropriations excessive costs prices increase cost living consumers forth conditions today indicate law worked perfectly chief weapon defense production act put president s hands achieve objectives law course authority control prices wages ineffectiveness controls apparent today true economic stabilization agency needed time get going set last fall one group today pretends purposes established consequential degree achieved certainly congress expected american people looked concrete results government fight economic stabilization achieved now yet congress many private american citizens entirely innocent contributing lack results example one controversial provisions defense production act congress wrote protection parity guaranties farmers seen figures quoted earlier cost living rose percent past year food prices come percent percent since korean war started food item workingman s budget despite fact present defense production law includes provision price controls ceiling imposed agricultural commodity highest either first parity prices commodity second highest price received producers period may june first price freeze put back january majority farm commodities parity one hundred sixty odd farm products listed agriculture department selling parity time prices frozen included beef cotton wool rice cottonseed lambs sheep veal calves long list selling parity included chickens eggs milk potatoes citrus fruits sugar many vegetables rise toward parity latter products foods parity january although risen still reached parity figure consequently can expect price increases food bad enough think congress allowed production law food prices rise fixed parity point matter ended perhaps provision guaranteeing parity prices might justified farmers stability however end indeed thing fixed parity prices farm products rise certain parity point naturally rise food prices resultant need higher wages consumer means turn prices farmers pay go necessitating establishment new higher parity price products many leading economists governmental officials greatly disturbed vicious inflationary circle caused parity provision run powerful farm bloc throughout country congress retention parity guaranty price control set will doubt negate pretty completely effect system announced price stabilizer mark dollar cent ceilings food items account percent nation s food budget order setting system whereby grocer example charge percent cost can tomatoes nothing bar higher farm prices accompanying rise retail food prices moreover present bitter opposition roll back prices farm products besides parity problem obstacles way price stabilization profiteering hoarding private american citizens profiteers hoarders obvious controls prices flexible soft wage control policy government hand comparatively inflexible hard exceptions general wage freeze ordered last january first allow wages rise percent january levels second authorize escalator clauses automatically adjust wages changes cost living index contracts january just governmental price controls credit controls large measure soft pseudo disciplinary true since defense production act passed government imposed certain credit controls bank credit real estate credit installment buying economists hold firm conviction enough done field seen earlier reason conviction fact last april april year commercial bank credit risen time high almost consumer credit alone today amounts almost resultant increase available purchasing power course added inflationary trend obvious particularly matter bank credit dam constructed keep back floodwaters easy money proved dangerously porous government witnessed months ago disagreement federal reserve system treasury department vital curbing credit since resolved much damage economy federal reserve board authorized provisions defense production act take steps raise reserve requirements impose controls selective nature installment buying regulation w housing credit regulation x hand accord fixed interest rates set treasury department bought buy united states government securities commercial banks banks turn used money sale securities extend credit according reserve requirements moreover bank can lend five six times amount money received federal reserve payment government securities sells thus see period imperative credit curbs applied federal reserve support government securities created new reservoir available credit figures bear show federal reserve bought government securities last half period total outstanding credit increased likewise figures show commercial banks steadily increased sale government securities time raised loans percent treasury opposed view federal reserve interest rates government bond issues raised result increase cost financing public debt now standing treasury federal reserve dispute resolved compromise president truman memorandum february suggested advisability first limiting private lending voluntary actions private groups second providing federal reserve powers impose additional requirements banks subsequently treasury department announced issuance new nonmarketable bonds interest rate stated minority views joint economic committee s report final compromise cooperative evolution program always advantageous one overlook great damage resulting economy country months long delay treasury federal reserve agreement elements involved today s economic instability one corporate profits received probably less attention public others prices wages increased reasonably comparable rate percent noted corporate profits increased almost percent taxes end june first quarter true excess profits legislation passed last december congress obviously enough one economists participating panel joint economic committee dr richard musgrave professor economics university michigan told committee felt present excess profits tax law really corporation income tax excess profits tax guise see much sense excess profits tax read correctly tells fellow must pay excess profits rates profits begin exceed credit may move back close regular rate excess profits come exceed one half income essence excess profits tax pay higher rate profits excessive stated doubted satisfied present tax long bill recently passed house tightens excess profit law somewhat might well circumstances will demand even stringent action excessive defense profits believe recommend therefore inflation stopped sane form economic stability restored federal government must first increase taxes pay go mobilization program must paid great measure equitable increased taxes personal income corporate excise taxes new tax bill doubtlessly correct step direction second formulate strong consistent across board system controls rents prices wages credit profits will necessitate parity revision current parity provision defense production act profits must controlled new strengthened excess profits tax third reduce nondefense governmental expenditures point budget can balanced even necessitates repeal modification existing laws suspension existing congress approved authorization example total already authorized law nondefense construction fourth encourage savings issuing public sale purchasing power bonds recently suggested professor slichter bonds guarantee holder get purchasing power back originally invested words inflationary period recur years hence time bond s maturity automatic adjustment made repaid holder value money equivalent purchasing power originally invested certainly clear suggested remedies will reduce completely inflationary tendencies personal savings greatly increased issuance purchasing power bonds eliminate inequities e type defense bonds seen considerable loss buying power suffered americans bought e bonds recent maturing dates example bond purchased may redeemed may year bring however purchasing power worth thus bond holder suffered net loss purchasing power original investment rearmament program started building military strength allies clearly decided impact upon stability economy may argue impact caused directly defense effort rather scare buying consumer business anticipation shortages unnecessary nondefense expansion may point fact almost three fourths increase gross national product expenditures second quarter till now spent nondefense purposes say whether net result obviously already strained economy attributable directly indirectly rearmament program plain fact strain remember mr wilson promised us next year imposed steps must taken taken fast restore american economy position stability inflationary forces now pushing cost living upward far severe history job controlling forces complicated already inflated price levels existence time commencement korean struggle faced serious complicated economic emergency action little late find present precarious position thus now paying will continue pay heavy price failure year ago take necessary actions control cost living therefore imperative defense production act will effect coming year impact defense program will heavily felt give president powers asked control economy provide common defense
