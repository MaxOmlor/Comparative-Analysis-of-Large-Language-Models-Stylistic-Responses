massachusetts new england also taxpayers united states situation brief comparable parent abandoning child wish pay medical expenses hope someone else will care child intends abandon whether care possible child case boston army base pier south boston mass built federal government tremendous value army course two world wars since except war years maritime administration held jurisdiction pier permit army order lease area commercial purposes public terminal operator present time boston tidewater terminals inc army continues use pier cargo shipments area maritime administration consistently netted sizable profit federal government lease property department commerce now told maritime administration must return control property jurisdiction army army originally indicated pier surplus needs arrangements concluded waterfront terminal section disposed general services administration surplus property bill introduced today urge prompt action congress provide continued army jurisdiction facilities lease commonwealth massachusetts speed federal government announced intention abandon maritime facilities without question induced necessity immediate costly repairs one half inch steel underwater skirt pilings constructed around pier prevent damage caused wood eating marine borers rust corrosion now worn steel tin can thinness hundreds holes developing year report survey made army engineering firm fay spofford thorndike stated extensive rehabilitation necessary prevent steel buckling time even day sand pouring pilings collapsing whole base sliding foot deep channel boston harbor army states funds available repairs maritime administration apparently unable undertake army base pier presently full use state deterioration hypothetical projected real prompt action must taken serious disaster including loss many lives much valuable property averted value boston army base pier value army congress fails take action prevent abandonment facilities will wasting valuable national asset federal government invested many millions dollars since original investment million replacement value pier estimated million million years ago nearly million spent additional

senior senator massachusetts mr saltonstall discussed question similar group included representatives maritime administration army finally april representatives office met interested parties agreed upon course action embodied bill introduced today ii alternative courses federal action three major courses available congress federal government first first hands nothing policy taking action prevent damage rehabilitate property vainly hoping private acquisition manner consistent national policies defense international trade federal government openly inviting disaster occur snapping single steel chain cause whole army base slide channel expensive economical alternative expensive loss life property expensive loss facilities port boston expensive cost removing collapsed wreck channel second second major alternative available congress authorize government take steps may necessary including removal various parts wharf structures prevent eventual collapse resulting destruction interference letter march corps engineers informed two schemes possible first cost million million provide period satisfactory safety years plan entails cutting present bulkhead approximately low water line removing supporting rods outer feet wharf apron placing fill water side bulkhead enable retention wharf pier sheds land storage although limited use possible although water side fill might hazard navigation strictly maintained order insure stability bulkhead b second scheme preventing collapse pier cost million million provide safety permanent basis lesser annual maintenance cost plan entails far extensive removals including removal entire sheet pile bulkhead tie rods apron distance feet face pier timber piling within area apron removed wharf sheds superstructure leave major portion pier shed land storage obviously first temporary plan unsatisfactory inasmuch simply means problem must faced years limited unsatisfactory use made pier second scheme permanent like plan emphasizes merely prevention collapse renders unusable piers thus unsatisfactory point view military economic value third third course action available adopted bill authorize funds rehabilitation pier order valuable maritime facilities may continue serve nation time peace war fay spofford thorndike survey considered number rehabilitation schemes rejected several army also eliminated practical alternative partial restoration pier order make usable three covered berths cost million doubtful assistance years result sifting three fundamental plans rehabilitating pier available remove present pier completely install place new open deck wharf construction cost million estimated life years b install new precast concrete sheet pile bulkhead outside present structure cost estimated million estimated life years lower resistance higher maintenance cost make steelplate scheme contemplates something similar now pier less advantageous c construct gravity type mass concrete seawall supported steel bearing piles located immediately outside present steel sheet pile bulkhead wharf widened feet might inconvenience although basically practical channel deepened new railroad facilities added using cast place concrete gravity wall result total construction cost million estimated life years precast concrete blocks used constructing gravity wall cost million estimated life years schemes analyzed terms cost per year life scheme c cast place gravity wall construction cost million least expensive alternative new concrete sheet pile bulkhead estimated life years lowest cost per year estimated life addition presents operation practical economical maintain present minimum amount hazards disturbance construction higher resistance fire explosion appear best possible schemes rehabilitation funds therefore provided bill introduced today certainly rehabilitation preferred plans removal collapse inactivity also considerable expense iii cost rehabilitation mr president hope congress will recognize responsibility federal government undertake rehabilitation valuable national asset manner discussed asset federal taxpayers invested substantial amount money valuable nation peacetime aid international trade general economy time war national emergency critical importance national defense effort unwise step now mean future mobilization efforts delayed facilities reconstructed reconverted delay well crucial race bring pier facilities necessary level million spent unnecessary reasonable maintenance restoration expenditure made today congress obligation taxpayers eliminate unnecessary expenses also obligation certain economy jeopardize security nation obligation reasonably certain present reduction expenses will result much greater expenditure future certainly expenditures consistent responsibility army maritime administration value obtained pier investment present policies federal government certainly expenditures large view amount federal money allocated massachusetts new england projects years current army civil functions appropriations bill came senate example will spent state massachusetts million rest country fact total amount spent six state new england area amount less received individual states practically contribute less tax revenues massachusetts alone similarly share six new england states continental nonclassified projects authorized defense public works bill percent total million three southern states georgia north carolina south carolina will receive percent however inasmuch commonwealth massachusetts also vitally affected maintenance facilities urged first touring pier march join financing rehabilitation bill provides well requiring commonwealth pay subsequent maintenance repair costs hear great deal talk days partnership federal government state local governments development projects beneficial opportunity federal government demonstrate worthy project means says prevent national disaster result either collapse pier unavailability military use emergency
