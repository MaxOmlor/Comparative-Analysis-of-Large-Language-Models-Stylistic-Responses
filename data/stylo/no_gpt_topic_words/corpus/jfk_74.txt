 want talk tonight federal budget like examine realistic non partisan manner fiscal problems faced present administration point difficulty administration faces carrying promises one year ago three separate factors must consider almost simultaneously examination federal government s fiscal problems course first federal budget schedule expenditures secondly federal revenues dependent primarily upon schedule various tax returns finally federal public debt consisting total individual deficits resulting imbalance previous two factors let us examine present prospective status three items federal budget first inquiry concerns federal budget year fiscal year federal government committed spend least billion dollars represents reduction expenditures budget submitted outgoing administration approximately billion unfortunately considerable portion savings false consisting deferment present obligations federal government civil service retirement veterans benefits following fiscal years estimated budget can cut another billion dollars can offer several examples cuts made view tax debt problems shall discuss momentarily means sufficient several reasons rather large budget cut far extensively first real difficulty effectuating cut budget sufficient extent fulfill campaign promises lies expenditures national security today although economic aid sharply reduced military budget dangerously decreased expenditures national security including defense department atomic energy military aid abroad civil defense constitute federal budget housing community development education research social security welfare health labor department appropriations added together hand total less federal budget interestingly enough among departments criticized severely budget department health education welfare cut congress amount submitted outgoing administration agriculture department post office department justice department secondly effective economies government restrained pressure particular items rivers harbors flood control projects gain support congressmen whose jurisdiction located subsidies airlines shipbuilders publishers agricultural interests others powerful friends beneficiaries agencies veterans administration soil conservation service many others third economy advocates faced large amount unspent funds authorized congress carried previous years whose expenditure already contracted july year funds totaled billion dollars counting special revolving loan funds billion dollars expenditures will show federal cash budget next years congress will little chance reduce will administration fourth finally matter fixed charges legal obligations obligations make federal budget include large items interest public debt increased present administration veterans compensation pension benefit programs farm price supports public assistance unemployment compensation payments federal highway aid payments fixed law short prospects reducing budget billion dollars next year will difficult particularly year s reductions will extremely difficult administration seeks announced increase civil defense make serious attempt develop civilian use atomic power worsening crisis indo china elsewhere globe requires american intervention farm surpluses require extensive government purchases important budget will difficult reduce sizable proportion congress american people realize level expenditures national security dangerously cut last year must proposed joint chiefs staff defense department bureau budget ii federal tax revenues realizing difficulty substantially lessening federal expenditures let us look side federal ledger tax returns income federal government present fiscal year expected reach less billion dollars sum will note billion dollars less expected expenditures although stated expenditures following fiscal year might drop billion income federal government expected drop like amount december excess profits tax will expire causing annual loss revenue amounting billion dollars january individual income taxes will take across board decrease including reduction individual capital gains tax annual loss billion dollars revenue april corporation income tax automatically decreases annual revenue loss billion dollars several excise taxes now bringing another billion dollars will expire april date addition strong pressure called tax revision bill will grant relief many areas supposed hardships inequities cost another billion dollars annual revenues permit tax reductions take place will cause loss federal revenues somewhere around billion dollars year making budget balancing impossible even great reductions federal expenditures suggested corporation income tax may reduced instead excise taxes permitted expire revised order double production revenues called tax revision bill postponed favorable time even steps taken expiration excess profits tax decrease personal income taxes will prevent revenues reaching point sufficient support adequate federal budget circumstances one may question whether can afford lose revenues federal government close tax loopholes percentage depletion allowance oil gas mining interests loopholes estimated cause annual loss revenues billion dollars hand revenues raised imposition general manufacturers excise tax familiar sales tax manufacturer s level however many many objections imposition general manufacturer s excise tax among others discriminatory tax taking greater proportion income small wage earner higher income brackets hitting harder poor family wealthy individual unsound tax taxing income profits consumption regardless level imposed clearly passed consumer imposed manufacturer s level effect tax pyramided mark wholesaler retailer cost product comes must necessity include percentage mark tax forms part cost moreover inasmuch included cost wholesalers retailers inventory latter required borrow capital acquisition inventory buy insurance cover pay higher personal property taxes pay higher commissions resale thus addition tax costs boost prices still higher result costs pyramided tax form taxation artificially inflationary unnecessarily increasing cost living business time every effort made hold time clearly reduces purchasing power consuming public consumer today limited number dollars spend upon purchase goods addition sales tax price products obviously increase number dollars consumer available obviously decreases number items can spend dollars true enough may transfer purchasing power federal government holding line recession interested buying power housewife worker farmer buys goods buying power federal government whose expenditures limited number items determined primarily tax revenues short general manufacturer s excise tax sales tax imposed federal government economically unsound concealment imposition manufacturer s level really make less painful discriminations evils resulting present system federal excise taxes state local sales taxes justify broadening discrimination envelop us adequate tax revenues federal government must maintained pointed difficulties alternatives exist respect task certainly general manufacturer s excise tax sales tax desirable alternative iii federal debt finally come consider third factor national debt doubt read newspapers statutory debt limit billion dollars amount fixed years ago tonight gross public debt federal government billion dollars less million dollars ceiling indeed small margin operate government spends million dollars every day president s request billion dollar increase statutory limit recall denied closing days congress now appears though government will squeeze first year partly reduction progress payments defense contracts reduction particularly hard small businessmen anxious avoid additional credit costs first months next year large portion tax revenues including least corporate income tax will paid debt drop months thereafter revenues decline expenditures maintained increase gross public debt beyond present statutory limit seems almost inevitable likelihood deficit increase total debt next two fiscal years obviously great inasmuch already pointed will difficult reduce expenditures already exceed income expected decline tax revenues moreover mild recession strike economy tax revenues will likely drop nearly billion fiscal theory will call reduction tax rates size deficit will still greater course desperate alternative federal government might sell public lands power developments projects order increase fluid assets reduce debt might call transfer social security unemployment compensation trust funds general treasury thus improving fiscal position books need tell dangerous alternatives indeed threatening rights interests people united states leading disastrous consequences future may cause still greater budgetary deficits iv optimistic view apparently grim least disillusioning picture federal expenditures substantially lessened unless endanger defensive strength federal taxes substantially reduced balance budget insisted congress keep tax loopholes open unless discriminatory undesirable sales tax imposed national debt reduced present debt limit will exceeded unless government adopts policies respect assets trust funds endanger security rights posterity although administration blamed tremendous expenditures world war ii korean conflicts large extent responsible situation time think can fairly place blame upon predecessor last year world war ii expenditures fiscal public debt risen rapidly war stood billion dollars close year surprisingly enough end fiscal gross national debt stood billion dollars drop nearly billion similarly net debt calculated basis called consolidated cash budget government based actual revenues expenditures types basis economic business analyses also showed sharp reduction years truman administration ultimate objective must quite obviously balanced budget within framework full employment inasmuch appears shall face continuing deficits time unless undesirable alternatives adopted might well remember incorrect premises upon much discussion national debt centered first deficit inflationary certainly tendency ample reason reduction causal relationship simple worst inflation experienced fiscal year year administrative budget showed sizable surplus subsequent years government showed deficit prices leveled year face sizable deficit yet financial pages indicate danger today recession inflation obviously economic factors important nation size deficit secondly balanced budget necessary give us strength maintain cold war view also fails look federal budget framework entire national economy us surely realize world war ii won military expenditures slashed point necessary balanced budget economy prosperous productive potential showed tremendous increase federal government financial productive resources draw upon even though meant incurring huge deficit able accomplish fantastic military production objectives order win war equally important emphasize today shall afford determined basis whether federal budget balanced basis defensive productive strength national objectives third unbalanced budget show unsound economy important look entire national picture past years national debt increased previously unheard levels time personal income employment savings planned investment profits increased period time record levels standard living purchasing power general prosperity national debt considerably less present debt ceiling us concerned national prosperity also considerably less years since every time bought savings bond sign prosperity yet time increased national debt course argument owe ignores difference taxpayers bond holders fact remains every dollar owed government dollar asset hands private citizen corporation asset regards part personal prosperity short nation whole living beyond means getting richer productive time financing huge war effort giving extensive aid nations whose economies support effort really living beyond means fourth result foregoing national debt burden distinguished national debt decreased increased end gross debt year s national income end august percentage national income less total public private debt country fallen national income end year s deficit concerned small fraction value year s national output thus addition seeking balanced budget also work full employment increasing productivity workers output plants income citizens order continue lightening debt burden certainly conclusion brings us back unites us profit sharing practices productivity workers industrial community will continue increase wages national income shall continue rise burden debt shall weigh less heavily us actual debt will decrease citizens become still prosperous
