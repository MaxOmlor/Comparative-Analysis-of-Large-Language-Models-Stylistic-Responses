 name greta thunberg years old come sweden speak behalf future generations know many don t want listen us say just children re repeating message united climate science many appear concerned wasting valuable lesson time assure will go back school moment start listening science give us future really much ask year will years old little sister beata will just like many children grandchildren great age told life ahead sure will great us fortunate born time place everyone told us dream big become whatever wanted live wherever wanted people like everything needed things grandparents even dream everything ever wish yet now may nothing now probably don t even future future sold small number people make unimaginable amounts money stolen us every time said sky limit live lied us gave us false hope told us future something look forward saddest thing children even aware fate awaits us will understand s late yet lucky ones will affected hardest already suffering consequences voices heard microphone can hear around year years days hours away now will position set irreversible chain reaction beyond human control will likely lead end civilisation know unless time permanent unprecedented changes aspects society taken place including reduction co emissions least please note calculations depending inventions yet invented scale inventions supposed clear atmosphere astronomical amounts carbon dioxide furthermore calculations include unforeseen tipping points feedback loops like extremely powerful methane gas escaping rapidly thawing arctic permafrost scientific calculations include already locked warming hidden toxic air pollution aspect equity climate justice clearly stated throughout paris agreement absolutely necessary make work global scale must also bear mind just calculations estimations means points return may occur bit sooner later one can know sure can however certain will occur approximately timeframes calculations opinions wild guesses projections backed scientific facts concluded nations ipcc nearly every single major national scientific body around world unreservedly supports work findings ipcc hear just said english ok microphone m beginning wonder last six months travelled around europe hundreds hours trains electric cars buses repeating life changing words one seems talking nothing changed fact emissions still rising travelling around speak different countries always offered help write specific climate policies specific countries really necessary basic problem everywhere basic problem basically nothing done halt even slow climate ecological breakdown despite beautiful words promises uk however special mind blowing historical carbon debt also current creative carbon accounting since uk achieved reduction territorial co emissions according global carbon project sound impressive numbers include emissions aviation shipping associated imports exports numbers included reduction around since average year according tyndall manchester main reason reduction consequence climate policies rather eu directive air quality essentially forced uk close old extremely dirty coal power plants replace less dirty gas power stations switching one disastrous energy source slightly less disastrous one will course result lowering emissions perhaps dangerous misconception climate crisis lower emissions far enough emissions stop stay c warming lowering emissions course necessary beginning fast process must lead stop within couple decades less stop mean net zero quickly negative figures rules today s politics fact speaking lowering instead stopping emissions perhaps greatest force behind continuing business usual uk s active current support new exploitation fossil fuels example uk shale gas fracking industry expansion north sea oil gas fields expansion airports well planning permission brand new coal mine beyond absurd ongoing irresponsible behaviour will doubt remembered history one greatest failures humankind people always tell millions school strikers proud accomplished thing need look emission curve m sorry s still rising curve thing look every time make decision ask will decision affect curve longer measure wealth success graph shows economic growth curve shows emissions greenhouse gases longer ask got enough money go also got enough carbon budget spare go must become centre new currency many people say don t solutions climate crisis right solve greatest crisis humanity ever faced solve war solve going moon first time solve inventing new inventions climate crisis easiest hardest issue ever faced easiest know must must stop emissions greenhouse gases hardest current economics still totally dependent burning fossil fuels thereby destroying ecosystems order create everlasting economic growth exactly solve ask us schoolchildren striking climate say one knows sure stop burning fossil fuels restore nature many things may quite figured yet say s answer say start treating crisis like crisis act even don t solutions s still answer say start talking circular economy rewilding nature need just transition don t understand talking say solutions needed known anyone therefore must unite behind science find together along way listen answers solving crisis don t even fully understand don t want understand don t listen science interested solutions will enable carry like like now answers don t exist act time avoiding climate breakdown will require cathedral thinking must lay foundation may know exactly build ceiling sometimes just simply find way moment decide fulfil something can anything m sure moment start behaving emergency can avoid climate ecological catastrophe humans adaptable can still fix opportunity will last long must start today excuses children sacrificing education childhood tell us consider politically possible society created taken streets take selfies us tell us really admire children wake adults children put differences aside start acting crisis children want hopes dreams back hope microphone hope hear
