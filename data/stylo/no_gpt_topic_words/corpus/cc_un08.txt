excellencies friends protocol observed pleasure join today let begin thanking g plus china strong voice climate action unity advocacy tenacity essential securing last year s historic loss damage agreement challenges keep growing many face crushing debt burdens fuelled sky high borrowing costs hamper efforts reduce emissions protect people increasingly deadly storms floods droughts creates paradox example africa home per cent world s best solar resources africa received two per cent global renewable energy investments last two decades african countries need financial technical support unleash renewables revolution true several regions global stocktake must create conditions surge global climate ambition beyond requires action three areas first finance developed countries must clarify delivery billion commitment need also see clear plan double adaptation finance billion year first step devoting least half climate finance adaptation need see much greater support new loss damage fund started well much money will permit want pay tribute professor saleemul huq bangladesh passed away recently member scientific advisory board luminary fight climate justice especially support loss damage excellencies climate finance still long way go eighteen times finance needed adaptation meet current needs developing countries international energy agency estimates transition net zero emerging markets developing economies will cost trillion annually outdated international financial architecture must reformed reflect realities today respond developing countries needs including relation bretton woods system international financial system must provide effective debt relief mechanism supports payment suspensions longer lending terms lower rates experience zambia demonstrates fragile mechanism put place g need effective debt relief mechanism need now international financial institutions must align policies plans programmes paris agreement need see increase capital base multilateral development banks reform business models leverage far private finance reasonable cost developing countries grants concessional finance essential leveraging private finance scale yet just thirty per cent developed countries public climate finance form grants proportion must rise significantly cop outcome say clearly second emissions must drastically reduced current policies take us towards three degree rise global temperature spells disaster particularly developing countries degree limit still possible precipice global stocktake must set clear expectation countries ndcs will align degree limit must set clear global science based pathway get need just fair equitable transition fossil fuels renewables cop must commit countries triple renewables capacity double energy efficiency bring clean energy phase fossil fuels roadmap equitable timeframe compatible degrees also essential existence countries room depends finally cop must strengthen international cooperation climate need collaboration governments countries companies align critical emitting sectors degrees put fair price carbon protect everyone earth effective early warning system support global transition net zero proposed climate solidarity pact big emitters make extra efforts cut emissions developed countries mobilize financial technical resources support emerging economies acceleration agenda supercharges efforts line principle common differentiated responsibilities respective capabilities light different national circumstances ask countries hit fast forward net zero timelines get soon possible developed countries emerging economies achieve net zero also need deploy clean energy technologies pace scale extraction critical minerals clean energy revolution wind farms solar panels battery manufacturing must done sustainable fair just way demand minerals set increase almost fourfold climate ambition summit heard repeated calls g leaders countries communities holding minerals fully benefit maximum local added value repeat mistakes past systematic exploitation developing countries reduced production basic raw materials today m pleased announce establishing panel critical energy transition minerals panel will bring together governments international organizations industry civil society develop common voluntary principles guide extractive industries years ahead name justice sustainability excellencies friends final fight keep degrees alive battling climate justice fights can win cop can win double objective maximum ambition mitigation maximum ambition relation climate justice namely taking full account interests developing countries must avoid costs compromise based minimum ambition mitigation minimum ambition climate justice developing countries losing twice losing climate justice losing without effective mitigation dramatic impacts climate change will suffered essentially vulnerable populations global south count g plus china keep pushing change world needs make cop game changer maximum ambition reduce emissions maximum ambition climate justice benefit developing countries populations thank
