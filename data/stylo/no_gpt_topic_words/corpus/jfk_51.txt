gentlemen feelings matter congressional responsibility connection sending troops europe europe important us resources manpower strategic location reasons denied russians think fair say american troops now withdrawn american troops now increased numbers europe s defense efforts collapse far easier communists seize power area therefore important place american troops europe leads us question many answer let us see role think obviously public policy united states take shoulders complete responsibility land defense western europe even seems therefore american troops europe three reasons participate actual defense area demonstrate europeans determined hold line probably important encourage europeans develop forces can objectives accomplished decide well summarize rearmament program europeans order determine extent effort extent european rearmament just returned trip europe visited three chief countries north atlantic treaty organization europe england france italy three countries west germany yugoslavia spain whose capacities loyalties obviously tied question defense west let us look briefly rearmament programs several countries number divisions will produce general eisenhower s command great britain great britain arms year around divisions now western germany will sent western germany placed command general eisenhower demands britain s manpower around world present much plan send area france france will arms year divisions west germany command general eisenhower moved forward quickly will add making total divisions italy italy limitations peace treaty allowed men army yet italy built limit although plans substantial just appropriated rearmament will time italian forces level even reach figure expected will serve large numbers outside italy belgium expected send two divisions western germany perhaps two one half divisions will placed border belgium dutch effort limited norwegian effort obviously will taken defending country portuguese effort naturally small will ineffective without assistance spain germany crucial factor think key whole problem defense europe western germany know brussels agreement planned german contingent serve brigade groups western european army limited one fifth total forces western european army think fair say plans western germany received brisk cool fashion germans kurt schumacher leader socialist party perhaps powerful figure western germany press conference bonn august expressed think prevailing german opinion said anyone talks german people contribution forces europe talks must contribution

must divisions united states talking says increasing american occupational force couple divisions great concentration american power forthcoming will say yes talked recently schumacher bonn set german conditions rearming first complete political freedom secondly allied screen protect rearmament russian retaliation german units take place line will obviously months years conclusions therefore troops must sent europe obvious will present rate sufficient land forces europe stop russians attack beginning soonest always possibility russians will attack time therefore base part defense policy possible assumption europe may lost basically interested however lowering date land forces europe will sufficient deter attack stop attack take place can done encouraging europeans make greater sacrifices order increase divisional strength united states aid proportionate european effort order think doubt aid must proportionate effort europeans ratio least mobile forces considering countries atlantic pact supplying large naval air elements heavy commitments elsewhere substantial part equipment european forces will american want job done opinion send proposed four divisions europe supplement two already insist additional american troops divisions sent western europeans shall place command general eisenhower divisions additional american division sent future european countries north atlantic pact will produce six program supervision appropriate congressional committee will report congress present limitation troops necessary come reluctantly conclusion must type limitation assistance knowledge undesirable features believe sometime clearer conception extent european effort ratio system might withdrawn general supervision congress program maintained present want job done want secure maximum benefits american contribution see alternative proposal ratio system additional reasons ratio system adopted pressures increase size american land forces europe will many varied natural interest american military chiefs secure better protection forces already committed seen already one arguments put forward sending additional four divisions protect two already addition responsible commander weakness north atlantic forces relation land armies enemy natural concern must regarding caliber forces will add desire dependable american units control united states commitments responsibilities viewed european salvation joined will european efforts increased american commitments europe see power united states salvation wish power defend liberate wonder europeans supported
