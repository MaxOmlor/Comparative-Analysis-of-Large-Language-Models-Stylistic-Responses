Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,
Gabon is the most carbon-positive country on earth, net absorbing
more than 100 million tons of CO2 every year. I plan to keep it that
way and will submit a new NDC post-Glasgow.
I call on countries that are not on track, particularly the 20 nations
that represent 80% of global emissions, to submit new NDCs in line
with 1.5 degrees.

We must establish a Marshall Plan on climate.
We need to rebuild trust, by honouring the pledge of US$100
billion per year.
This symbolic commitment will need be multiplied tenfold beyond
2025, in order to meet the real needs of developing countries.
We must clearly define our common adaptation goal.
Even if we achieve our one point five degree target, climate change
will still entail enormous costs.
Within this framework, nature-based solutions are an effective
environmental and economic response.
Finally, we must demonstrate strong leadership to all those who are
watching us, in particular to future generations.
I call on all negotiators to be flexible and to finalize the "Paris
Agreement's rulebook."
Under no circumstances should we allow ourselves to relive Madrid's
frustration. 
Thank you.
