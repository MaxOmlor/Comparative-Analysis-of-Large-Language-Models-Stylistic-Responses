Mr. President, 35 years ago today, the independence of Lithuania was proclaimed.
February 16, 1918, is a day comparable to our day of independence, July 4, 1776.
It is a day of freedom â€“ a freedom that continued from 1918 until 1940, and an annual reminder of freedom which will come again when the Communist invaders are overthrown.
I am proud, Mr. President, that our Government has never recognized the unjust annexation of Lithuania by the Soviet Union in 1940. We still recognize what was proclaimed 35 years ago.
Today, free-minded people in Lithuania, the million Americans of Lithuanian descent, and all Americans renew their faith that in the not-too-distant future Lithuania will once again take her rightful place in the family of free nations.
