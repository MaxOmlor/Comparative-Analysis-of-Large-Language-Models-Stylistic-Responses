Prime Minister Johnson, I want to 
thank you and COP President Alok 
Sharma for your hospitality, 
leadership, and tireless efforts in the 
preparation of this COP. 
Excellencies, 
The six years since the Paris 
Climate Agreement have been the 
six hottest years on record. 
Our addiction to fossil fuels is 
pushing humanity to the brink.
We face a stark choice: Either we 
stop it — or it stops us. 
It’s time to say: enough. 
Enough of brutalizing biodiversity. 
Enough of killing ourselves with 
carbon.
Enough of treating nature like a 
toilet. 
Enough of burning and drilling and 
mining our way deeper.
We are digging our own graves. 
Our planet is changing before our 
eyes — from the ocean depths to 
mountain tops; from melting 
glaciers to relentless extreme 
weather events.
Sea-level rise is double the rate it
was 30 years ago.
Oceans are hotter than ever — and 
getting warmer faster.
Parts of the Amazon Rainforest now 
emit more carbon than they absorb.
Recent climate action announcements 
might give the impression that we are 
on track to turn things around.
This is an illusion. 
The last published report on 
Nationally Determined 
Contributions showed that they 
would still condemn the world to a 
calamitous 2.7 degree increase. 
And even if the recent pledges were 
clear and credible — and there are 
serious questions about some of 
them — we are still careening 
towards climate catastrophe.
Even in the best-case scenario, 
temperatures will rise well above 
two degrees.
So, as we open this much anticipated 
climate conference, we are still 
heading for climate disaster. 
Young people know it. 
Every country sees it. 
Small Island Developing States —
and other vulnerable ones — live it.
For them, failure is not an option. 
Failure is a death sentence.
Excellencies, 
We face a moment of truth. 
We are fast approaching tipping 
points that will trigger escalating
feedback loops of global heating. 
But investing in the net zero, 
climate resilient economy will 
create feedback loops of its own —
virtuous circles of sustainable 
growth, jobs and opportunity. 
We have progress to build upon. 
A number of countries have made 
credible commitments to net-zero 
emissions by mid-century. 
Many have pulled the plug on 
international financing of coal.
Over 700 cities are leading the way
to carbon neutrality.
The private sector is waking up. 
The Net-Zero Asset Owners Alliance
— the gold standard for credible
commitments and transparent targets 
— is managing $10 trillion in assets
and catalyzing change across 
industries.
The climate action army — led by 
young people — is unstoppable.
They are larger. They are louder. 
And, I assure you, they are not going 
away.
I stand with them.
Excellencies,
The science is clear. We know 
what to do.
First, we must keep the goal of 1.5
degrees Celsius alive.
This requires greater ambition on
mitigation and immediate concrete
action to reduce global emissions by
45 per cent by 2030.
G20 countries have a particular 
responsibility as they represent 
around 80 per cent of emissions. 
According to the principle of 
common but differentiated 
responsibilities in light of national 
circumstances, developed countries 
must lead the effort.
But emerging economies, too, must 
go the extra mile, as their 
contribution is essential for the 
effective reduction of emissions.
We need maximum ambition – from 
all countries on all fronts – to make 
Glasgow a success. 
I urge developed countries and 
emerging economies to build 
coalitions to create the financial and 
technological conditions to 
accelerate the decarbonization of 
the economy as well as the phase 
out of coal. These coalitions are 
meant to support the large emitters 
that face more difficulties in the 
transition from grey to green. 
Let’s have no illusions: if 
commitments fall short by the end 
of this COP, countries must revisit 
their national climate plans and 
policies. 
Not every five years. Every year. 
Until keeping to 1.5 degrees is 
assured.
Until subsidies to fossil fuels end.
Until there is a price on carbon.
And until coal is phased out. 
But we also need greater clarity. 
There is a deficit of credibility and a 
surplus of confusion over emissions 
reductions and net zero targets, with 
different meanings and different 
metrics. 
That is why – beyond the 
mechanisms already established in 
the Paris Agreement – I am 
announcing today that I will
establish a Group of Experts to
propose clear standards to measure 
and analyze net zero commitments
from non-state actors. 
Second, we must do more to protect 
vulnerable communities from the 
clear and present dangers of climate 
change. 
Over the last decade, nearly 4 billion 
people suffered climate-related 
disasters. 
That devastation will only grow.
Adaptation works. 
Early warning systems save lives. 
Climate-smart agriculture and 
infrastructure save jobs. 
All donors must allocate half their 
climate finance to adaptation. 
Public and multilateral development 
banks should start as soon as 
possible. 
Third, this COP must be a moment 
of solidarity.
The $100 billion a year climate 
finance commitment in support of 
developing countries must become a 
$100 billion climate finance reality.
This is critical to restoring trust and 
credibility. 
I welcome efforts led by Canada 
and Germany to help get us there. 
It is a first step — but it delays the 
largest support for years, with no 
clear guarantees. 
But beyond the $100 billion, 
developing countries need far greater 
resources to fight COVID-19, build 
resilience and pursue sustainable 
development. 
Those suffering the most – namely, 
Least Developed Countries and 
Small Island Developing States –
need urgent funding.
More public climate finance. More 
overseas development aid. More 
grants. Easier access to funding. 
And multilateral development banks 
must work much more seriously at 
mobilizing greater investment 
through blended and private 
finance. 
Excellencies, 
The sirens are sounding. 
Our planet is telling us something.
And so are people everywhere.
Climate action tops the list of 
people’s concerns, across countries, 
age and gender. 
We must listen — we must act —
and we must choose wisely. 
On behalf of this and future 
generations, I urge you:
Choose ambition. 
Choose solidarity. 
Choose to safeguard our future and 
save humanity.
Thank you.
