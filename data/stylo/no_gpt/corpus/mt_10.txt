Just a moment. Good evening. Good evening gentlemen.
I am naturally very pleased that I got more than half the Parliamentary Party and disappointed that it's not quite enough to win on the first ballot, so I confirm it is my intention to let my name go forward for the second ballot.
Look, I have …
I have got more than half the votes of the Parliamentary Party. It was not quite the fifteen per cent above those of Mr. Heseltine—I think it's about 14.6 per cent—so it means we have to go for a second ballot, so I confirm that I shall let my name go forward.
I must go and do some telephone calls.
Thank you very much, thank you.
