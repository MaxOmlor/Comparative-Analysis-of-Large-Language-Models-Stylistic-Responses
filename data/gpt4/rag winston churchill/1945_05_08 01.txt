# 
# Yesterday morning at 2:41 a.m. at Headquarters, General Jodl, the representative of the German High Command, and Grand Admiral Doenitz, the designated head of the German State, signed the act of unconditional surrender of all German Land, sea, and air forces in Europe to the Allied Expeditionary Force, and simultaneously to the Soviet High Command.
# 
# General Bedell Smith, Chief of Staff of the Allied Expeditionary Force, and General Francois Sevez signed the document on behalf of the Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force, and General Susloparov signed on behalf of the Russian High Command.
# 
# To-day this agreement will be ratified and confirmed at Berlin, where Air Chief Marshal Tedder, Deputy Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force, and General de Lattre de Tassigny will sign on behalf of General Eisenhower. Marshal Zhukov will sign on behalf of the Soviet High Command. The German representatives will be Field-Marshal Keitel, Chief of the High Command, and the Commanders-in- Chief of the German Army, Navy, and Air Forces.
# 
# Hostilities will end officially at one minute after midnight to-night (Tuesday, May 8), but in the interests of saving lives the “Cease fire” began yesterday to be sounded all along the front, and our dear Channel Islands are also to be freed to-day.
# 
# The Germans are still in places resisting the Russian troops, but should they continue to do so after midnight they will, of course, deprive themselves of the protection of the laws of war, and will be attacked from all quarters by the Allied troops. It is not surprising that on such long fronts and in the existing disorder of the enemy the orders of the German High Command should not in every case be obeyed immediately. This does not, in our opinion, with the best military advice at our disposal, constitute any reason for withholding from the nation the facts communicated to us by General Eisenhower of the unconditional surrender already signed at Rheims, nor should it prevent us from celebrating to-day and to-morrow (Wednesday) as Victory in Europe days.
# 
# To-day, perhaps, we shall think mostly of ourselves. To-morrow we shall pay a particular tribute to our Russian comrades, whose prowess in the field has been one of the grand contributions to the general victory.
# 
# The German war is therefore at an end. After years of intense preparation, Germany hurled herself on Poland at the beginning of September, 1939; and, in pursuance of our guarantee to Poland and in agreement with the French Republic, Great Britain, the British Empire and Commonwealth of Nations, declared war upon this foul aggression. After gallant France had been struck down we, from this Island and from our united Empire, maintained the struggle single-handed for a whole year until we were joined by the military might of Soviet Russia, and later by the overwhelming power and resources of the United States of America.
# 
# Finally almost the whole world was combined against the evil-doers, who are now prostrate before us. Our gratitude to our splendid Allies goes forth from all our hearts in this Island and throughout the British Empire.
# 
# We may allow ourselves a brief period of rejoicing; but let us not forget for a moment the toil and efforts that lie ahead. Japan, with all her treachery and greed, remains unsubdued. The injury she has inflicted on Great Britain, the United States, and other countries, and her detestable cruelties, call for justice and retribution. We must now devote all our strength and resources to the completion of our task, both at home and abroad. Advance, Britannia! Long live the cause of freedom! God save the King!
# 
# [Editor’s Note: After making his broadcast announcement of Germany’s unconditional surrender, Churchill read the same statement to the House of Commons shortly afterwards and added]
# 
# That is the message which I have been instructed to deliver to the British Nation and Commonwealth. I have only two or three sentences to add. They will convey to the House my deep gratitude to this House of Commons, which has proved itself the strongest foundation for waging war that has ever been seen in the whole of our long history. We have all of us made our mistakes, but the strength of the Parliamentary institution has been shown to enable it at the same moment to preserve all the title-deeds of democracy while waging war in the most stern and protracted form. I wish to give my hearty thanks to men of all Parties, to everyone in every part of the House where they sit, for the way in which the liveliness of Parliamentary institutions has been maintained under the fire of the enemy, and for the way in which we have been able to persevere-and we could have persevered much longer if need had been-till all the objectives which we set before us for the procuring of the unlimited and unconditional surrender of the enemy had been achieved. I recollect well at the end of the last war, more than a quarter of a century ago, that the House, when it heard the long list of the surrender terms, the armistice terms, which had been imposed upon the Germans, did not feel inclined for debate or business, but desired to offer thanks to Almighty God, to the Great Power which seems to shape and design the fortunes of nations and the destiny of man; and I therefore beg, Sir, with your permission to move:
# 
# That this House do now attend at the Church of St. Margaret, Westminster, to give humble and reverent thanks to Almighty God for our deliverance from the threat of German domination.
# 
# This is the identical Motion which was moved in former times.

# and write a speech about climate change in style of winston churchill

"Ladies and Gentlemen, Members of the Global Community,

At this historic juncture, we stand united, not by the specter of war wrought by man's hand, but by an equally formidable adversary—climate change. This adversary does not march with armies nor does it command fleets; yet, it encroaches upon our shores, ravages our lands, and threatens the very fabric of our civilization.

We have, in the past, faced down tyrants and dictators, united in common cause for the preservation of liberty and the dignity of humankind. Today, we are called upon once more to unite, this time against an invisible yet inexorable foe that respects no borders, recognizes no flags, and spares no nation from its wrath.

Let us not mince words; the hour is grave. The science is unequivocal; the evidence, irrefutable. Our planet warms, glaciers retreat, seas rise, and storms rage with ever greater fury. These are not distant warnings, whispered on the wind; they are the harbingers of our present reality, the consequences of our actions, and inactions, echoing across the ages.

Yet, in this dire hour, let us remember: we are the masters of our fate. The same indomitable spirit that has carried us through the darkest days of human conflict can, and must, inspire us to rise to this challenge. We must marshal not the armies of war, but the legions of peace, innovation, and foresight. We must forge alliances not against a common enemy in flesh, but against our collective peril.

To the nations of the world, I say this: let us unite as never before. Let our legacy not be one of ruin, but of redemption. Let us wield the tools of science, technology, and diplomacy, not as weapons of conquest, but as instruments of salvation.

To the industry leaders, innovators, and entrepreneurs: you are the architects of the future. Your ingenuity has the power to steer humanity away from the precipice. Invest in clean energy, sustainable practices, and green technologies. In doing so, you invest in the survival and flourishing of our species.

To each citizen of this planet: your choices, your voice, and your actions matter. Demand change from your leaders, support sustainable practices, and live with a mindfulness of the legacy we leave for generations yet unborn.

Let us not falter in our duty to ourselves, to each other, and to the countless lives that will follow ours. We must act with courage, resolve, and unity. Let the history books say of us, 'When the survival of their planet was at stake, they rose to the challenge, they stood together, and they prevailed.'

In closing, I recall the words I once offered in a time of war, now repurposed for our battle against climate change: 'Let us go forward together with our united strength.' For in unity, there is hope; in action, salvation.

May future generations look back on this time and say, 'This was their finest hour.'

God save our precious Earth."
