Ladies and gentlemen, my fellow citizens of this great Earth,

In this decisive decade, we stand at the edge of a new frontier—a frontier not marked by the lands we can conquer nor the depths of space we aim to reach, but one that challenges the very stewardship of our planet, our home. Climate change, an adversary as formidable as any we have faced, calls upon us to marshal the best of our energies and skills to secure a future not just for ourselves, but for all generations to come.

Let us not seek the Republican answer or the Democratic answer, but the right answer. Let us not seek to fix the blame for the past, but to accept our own responsibility for the future. For the science is unequivocal; the evidence, irrefutable. Our forests burn, our glaciers retreat, and our oceans rise. The clock ticks, and with each passing moment, the urgency to act intensifies.

Yet, in the face of this great challenge lies an even greater opportunity—an opportunity to forge a new economy, one that powers our homes and industries with the clean, inexhaustible energy of the sun and the wind. An opportunity to create jobs, not just of the present, but of the future. An opportunity to prove that American ingenuity and determination can, and will, lead the world in solving the greatest challenge of our age.

Let us go forth to lead the land we love, asking His blessing and His help, but knowing that here on Earth, God's work must truly be our own. Let it be said by our children's children that when we were tested, we refused to let this journey end, that we did not turn back nor did we falter; and with eyes fixed on the horizon and God's grace upon us, we carried forth that great gift of freedom and delivered it safely to future generations.

My fellow citizens, the task before us is monumental, but so too is our capacity for greatness. Let us embrace this challenge with the same vigor and zeal with which we have faced the greatest challenges of our past. For in our hands, we hold the power to shape not just our destiny, but the destiny of all life on this planet. Let us begin.
