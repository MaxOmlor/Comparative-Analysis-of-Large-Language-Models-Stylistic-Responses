Excellencies,
Ladies and gentlemen,
There is no escaping the facts.
Climate change threatens our survival. The beating drum of science … the 
facts … have been loud and clear for some time. 
But it has taken too long for our ears to hear … what our eyes have been
seeing all around us.
The recent IPCC report lays out the stark facts. Our time to act … is short.
But it is not too late. 
We know what we have to do … it is not a mystery. Cap global warming 
to 1.5 degrees Celsius.
And we have one generation to get it done.
Europe is leading the way. In 2019, we committed to becoming the first 
carbon neutral continent, by 2050. 
And now … two years later … others have gotten on board.
But it’s one thing to make a pledge. It’s quite another … to take action. 
That’s the hard part. The part that takes … real leadership.
It will also take real courage, creativity, and cooperation.
1. Courage … because we must take courageous decisions. Our 
history is full of bold, visionary, and yes, courageous decisions. 
Now it is time to take perhaps the greatest decision of them all … to 
save our planet.
2. It will take creativity … and imagination … to innovate and build
the technologies. And scale them up … with public and private 
investment. 
Let’s tap into humankind’s infinite spirit of innovation and 
entrepreneurship … for the good of our planet.
3. And we will need … cooperation. Cooperation and solidarity. To 
make sure that everyone benefits from this green transformation. 
We don’t all start from the same point. But together …we must all 
be working toward the same end …
A healthy, sustainable planet … for generations to come.
[Now I will pass the floor to the President of the European 
Commission … President Von der Leyen…]
Thank you.
