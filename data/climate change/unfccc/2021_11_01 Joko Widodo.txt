orest fires were down by 82% in 2020.
• Indonesia has begun the rehabilitation of mangrove forests covering
an area of 600,000 ha by 2024, the largest in the world.
• Indonesia has also rehabilitated 3 million critical lands between 2010
– 2019.
• The sector which initially contributed 60% of Indonesia's emissions,
will reach the Carbon Net Sink by 2030.
3. In the energy sector, we continue to progress … 
• with the development of electric vehicle ecosystem…
• Building Southeast Asia’s largest solar power plant…
• Utilisation of new and renewable energy, including biofuels…
• and development of clean energy-based industries… including the 
world's largest green industrial park in North Kalimantan..
4. However, these are not enough.
• We, especially as a country with large green areas and regreening
potential…
• and as a country with vast seas that have the potential to contribute
to carbon sequestration…
• need support and contribution from developed countries.
5. Indonesia will continue to mobilize climate finance and innovative
financing, such as blended finance, green bonds and green sukuk.

6. Fulfillment of climate finance by developed country partners is a game 
changer in climate change mitigation and adaptation for developing 
countries.
7. Indonesia itself will be able to contribute faster to the world's Net-Zero
Emissions goal.
• The question is then, how sizeable are developed countries’ 
contributions for us?
• What kind of transfers of technology can be provided?
• What programs can be supported to achieve the SDGs targets that 
have been hampered by the pandemic?
8. In addition, carbon market and carbon pricing…must be part of the
efforts to address climate change issues…
9. A carbon economy ecosystem that is transparent and has integrity…
inclusive and fair… must be created.
Excellencies…
10. There is no point in blaming each other, let alone create conflicts.
• There is no value in becoming a victor … in a sinking world.
11. In closing … at this Summit…on behalf of the Archipelagic and Small 
Island States Forum (AIS)…Indonesia is honored to be able to circulate a 
Joint Statement of the Archipelagic and Island States Forum 
Leaders.
12. The AIS Forum will continue to promote maritime cooperation and climate 
action in serving the UNFCCC.
