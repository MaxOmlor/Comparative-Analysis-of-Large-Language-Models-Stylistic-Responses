Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Let me begin by saluting last year’s decision by the International Civil Aviation Organization’s Assembly to adopt a collective net-zero emissions goal by 2050.

Reaching this bold target will be a massive task.

Last year, the aviation sector accounted for 2% of global emissions.

It’s one of the most challenging sectors to decarbonize.

But with innovation and investment, it can be done.

A net-zero aviation sector means adopting clean energy sources on a global scale.

It means economic policies and regulations that can support a just and equitable transition while attracting investors.

And it means measures such as carbon pricing, low-carbon fuel standards and subsidies for sustainable aviation fuels.

The global framework emerging from this conference on aviation and alternative fuels is a critical step towards a clean and prosperous future for this vital sector.

By moving at jet speed, you can speed-up the clean energy revolution our world needs.

With the upcoming COP28 meeting around the corner, now is the time to turn ambition into concrete action, find ways to deliver on your net-zero target, and shape a better, cleaner future for all.
